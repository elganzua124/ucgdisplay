Troubleshooting

1. Demangle symbols
    nm -uD libucgdisp.so  | grep _ZN5gpiod4chipC1ERKSsi | c++filt -n


2. Undefined symbol?
    Make sure the correct compilers are used and points to the right location.
    Some could be mixed and point to /usr/local/* directory. If this is the case, You can either manually fix the symbolic links
    or just clean /usr/local as a last resort.

    The command below cleans all the files/symbolic links under /usr/local* recursively. Folder structure is retained.

    # clean files
    sudo find /usr/local -type f -delete

    # clean symbolic links
    sudo find /usr/local -type f -xtype l
